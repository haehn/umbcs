	<blockquote>
    It is the expressed policy of the University that every aspect of academic life not only formal 
    coursework situations, but all relationships and interactions connected to the educational 
    process shall be conducted in an absolutely and uncompromisingly honest manner. 
    The University presupposes that any submission of work for academic credit indicates that the 
    work is the student’s own and is in compliance with University policies. In cases where academic 
    dishonesty is discovered after completion of a course or degree program, sanctions may be imposed 
    retroactively, up to and including revocation of the degree. Any student who reasonably believes 
    another student has committed an act of academic dishonesty should inform the course instructor 
    of the alleged violation.
