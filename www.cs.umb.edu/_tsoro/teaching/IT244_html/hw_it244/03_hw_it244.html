</h2>

	<h3 class="section">Due Sunday, February 11th at 11:59 PM</h3>
	
	<h3 class="section">Deliverables</h3>
	All this work should be done on <span class="host">users3.cs.umb.edu</span>.
	<ol>
		<li>
			A <span class="path">.plan</span> file in your home directory
			<br><br>
		</li>
		<li>
	        A shell script named <span class="path">hw3.sh</span> that performs the operations listed below.<br>
	        This file should be in an <span class="path">hw3</span> directory inside your 
			<span class="path">hw</span> directory inside your <span class="path">it244</span> directory.<br>
			See this <a href="../shell_scripts_homework.html">document</a> for instructions on creating this script.
	    </li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3 class="section">Details</h3>
		<h4><span class="path">.plan</span></h4>
		Go to your home directory and create a text file with the name<span class="path">.plan</span>. <br>
		Put some information about yourself in this file. <br>
		The text in this file will be printed	to the terminal when <code>finger</code> is run on your Unix ID or name. <br>
		Use <code>nano</code> or any other Unix text editor to create this file.

	<h4>The shell script named <span class="path">hw3.sh</span></h4>
		Create an <span class="path">hw3</span> directory in your <span class="path">hw</span> directory 
	    inside your <span class="path">it244</span> directory. 
		<br><br>
		Go to this <span class="path">hw3</span> directory.
		<br><br>
		Run Unix commands that will execute the steps below. 
		<br><br>
		When you have a command line that does what the step asks you to do, copy it from the 
		command line and paste it into <span class="path">hw3.sh</span> using <code>nano</code> or any other text editor.
	    <br><br>
	    When you have completed all the steps, create an echo statement before the commands for each step,
	    that will print the step number to the terminal.
	    <br><br>
	    Make sure that your script meets all of the requirements mentioned
		<a href="../shell_scripts_homework.html">here</a>.

	    <li> <!-- Step 1 -->
	        Print to the terminal the contents of the file <span class="path">red_sox.txt</span> in <span class="path">/home/tsoro/course_files/it244_files</span> 
	    </li>
	    <li> <!-- Step 2 -->
	        Using grep and pipes, <span class="char">|</span> , select all the Red Sox away games where they won, except
	        for the games they played against the Orioles <br>
	        Away games are indicated by the <span class="char">@</span> symbol
		</li>
		<li> <!-- Step 3 -->
			Select all the Red Sox away games where they won, except
			for the games they played against the Orioles, sorted by date in reverse order
		</li>
		<li> <!-- Step 4 -->
			Print the contents of the file <span class="path">foo.txt</span> in <span class="path">/home/tsoro/course_files/it244_files</span> to the
			terminal
		</li>
		<li> <!-- Step 5 -->
			Print to the terminal the contents of <span class="path">foo.txt</span>, 
			selecting only those lines with the word "foo" as a whole word <br>
			In other words, "foo" must <b>NOT</b> appear as part of another string,
			like "foobbbbbbbb". <br>
			There is an option for <code>grep</code> that tells it to only match the string when it
			appears as a word, not as part of a bigger string <br>
			Check the <code>man</code> page for <code>grep</code> to find this option
			<br>
			Don't call the <code>man</code> page from within your shell script.
		</li>
		<li> <!-- Step 6 -->
			Print to the terminal the lines in <span class="path">foo.txt</span> that have the string ### in them
		</li>
		<li> <!-- Step 7 -->
			Print the contents of the file <span class="path">numbers1.txt</span> in <span class="path">/home/tsoro/course_files/it244_files</span> to
			the terminal
		</li>
		<li> <!-- Step 8 -->
			Use head and tail to print to the terminal lines 6 through 13 in <span class="path">numbers1.txt</span>
		</li>
		<li> <!-- Step 9 -->
			Use sort to print to the terminal the contents of <span class="path">numbers1.txt</span> in reverse numerical order
		</li>
		<li> <!-- Step 10 -->
			Use diff to print to the terminal the differences between <span class="path">numbers1.txt</span> and <span class="path">numbers2.txt</span> in a human
			readable format
		</li>
		<li> <!-- Step 11 -->
			Print to the terminal the name of the host to which you are connected
		</li>
		<li> <!-- Step 12-->
			Consult the <code>man</code> page for date, then use this command to print to the terminal the date in the format
			yyyy-mm-dd. 
			<br>
			Don't call the <code>man</code> page from within your shell script. 
		</li>
		<li> <!-- Step 13 -->
			Print to the terminal the location of the executable file for <code>perl</code>, a scripting language. The command
			you use should only work for executable files
		</li>
		<li> <!-- Step 14 -->
			Find all files that have the string "nano" in their filename
		</li>
		<li> <!-- Step 15 -->
			List all the users currently logged in to <span class="host">users3</span>
		</li>
		<li> <!-- Step 16 -->
			Run <code>finger</code> on your Unix username to print to the terminal the information you entered
			in your <span class="path">.plan</span> file
		</li>
