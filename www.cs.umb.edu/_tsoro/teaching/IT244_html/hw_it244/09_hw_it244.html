	        This file should be in an <span class="path">hw9</span> directory inside your

	<h3 class="section">Requirements</h3>
	<ul class="flat">
		<li>Create an <span class="path">hw9</span> directory in your <span class="path">hw</span> directory 
    		inside your <span class="path">it244</span> directory
    	</li>
    	<li>Go to the <span class="path">hw9</span> directory and run Unix commands that will execute the steps below</li>
    	<li>When you have a command line that does what the step asks you to do, paste it into 
			<span class="path">hw9.sh</span> using <code>nano</code> or any other text editor
		</li>
		<li>When you have completed all the steps, create an <code>echo</code> statement before the commands

	<h4>Modifications to your startup files</h4>
	<ol start="1">
	    <li><!-- Step 1 -->
	        Go to your home directory and edit <span class="path">.bash_profile</span> to define the global variable <span class="iden">omar</span> 
	        whose value is the <b>absolute pathname</b> of my home directory.
	    </li>
	    
	    <li> <!-- Step 2 -->
	        Again in <span class="path">.bash_profile</span> define an alias <span class="iden">ts</span> which will take you to my home directory using the variable defined above.
	    </li>
	    
	    <li> <!-- Step 3 -->
	        Also in <span class="path">.bash_profile</span> define a function <span class="iden">go_show</span>, that will
	        <ul class="flat">       
	            <li class="flat">Go to a specific directory</li>
	            <li class="flat">Print your current location</li>
	            <li class="flat">Print the contents of your current directory</li>
	        </ul>
	        <br>
	        The directory this function takes you to will be specified as an argument to the function on the command line. 
	        You will need to use a positional parameter to do this.
	    </li>
	</ol>
    
    <h4>Steps for Script</h4>
	<ol start="4">    
	    <li> <!-- Step 4 -->
	        Print to the terminal the value of the variable <span class="iden">omar</span>.
	    </li>
		<li> <!-- Step 5 -->
	        Using a pipeline, <code>grep</code> and a command that will show all your global variables, print to the
	        screen the full  definition of the variable <span class="iden">omar</span>. <b>Do not use <code>echo</code></b>
	        to do this. The command to show all global variables was mentioned in the first class were global variables
	        were discussed.
		</li>
		<li> <!-- Step 6 -->
	        Aliases and functions are not global, so they cannot normally be run inside a shell script. 
	        <ul class="flat">       
	            <li class="flat">Go to your home directory</li>
	            <li class="flat">Run a command that will run the startup file where you defined the alias <span class="iden">ts</span>
	                and the function <span class="iden">go_show</span> inside your current shell
	            </li>
	            <li class="flat">Run a command that will show the definition of the function <span class="iden">go_show</span></li>
	        </ul>
	    </li>
		<li> <!-- Step 7 -->
		    Go to <b>your</b> home directory.<br>
	        Use the function <span class="iden">go_show</span> to move to <b>my</b> home directory using the global 
	        variable <span class="iden">omar</span>.
		</li>
		<li> <!-- Step 8 -->
	        Run a command that will show all the aliases you have currently defined.
		</li>
		<li> <!-- Step 9 -->
		   Run a command that will show the last 20 commands in your history list.
		</li>
		<li> <!-- Step 10 -->
			Create the variable <span class="iden">omar_home</span> whose value is the following
			<pre>
The home directory of my instructor is /home/tsoro</pre>
	    		When you define this variable, it <b>must</b> use the value of the variable <span class="iden">omar</span>.
	    		<br>
	    		Now print the value of <span class="iden">omar_home</span> to the terminal.
		</li>
	</ol>
