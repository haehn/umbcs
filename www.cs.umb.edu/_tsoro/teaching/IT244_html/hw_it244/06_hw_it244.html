    IT 244: Introduction to Linux/Unix <br>
    Homework 6
</h2>

	<h3 class="section">Due Sunday, March 04th at 11:59 PM</h3>
	All this work should be done on <span class="host">users3.cs.umb.edu</span>
	
	<h3 class="section">Deliverables</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			A shell script named <span class="path">hw6.sh</span> that performs the operations listed below. <br>
        	This file should be in an <span class="path">hw6</span> directory inside your 
        	<span class="path">hw</span> directory inside your <span class="path">it244</span> directory. <br>
        	100 points
  		</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Requirements</h3>
	<ul class="flat">
		<li>Create an <span class="path">hw6</span> directory in your <span class="path">hw</span> directory 
    		inside your <span class="path">it244</span> directory
    	</li>
    	<li>Go to the <span class="path">hw6</span> directory and run Unix commands that will execute the steps below</li>
    	<li>When you have a command line that does what the step asks you to do, paste it into 
			<span class="path">hw6.sh</span> using <code>nano</code> or any other text editor
		</li>
		<li>When you have completed all the steps, create an <code>echo</code> statement before the commands 
    		for each step, that will print the step number to the terminal
    	</li>
    </ul>
    
	<h3>Testing</h3>
	<ul class="flat">       
         <li>The script <span class="path">hw6.sh</span> <b>must</b> have the format specified in
        	this <a href="../shell_scripts_homework.html">document</a>
        </li>
        <li>Scripts that do not follow the rules specified in the document mentioned above will 
        	will have points deducted from their score
        </li>
        <li>Be sure to test your script and correct any errors you find</li>
        <li>You will lose 5 points for each error that occurs when running your script</li>
        <li>To run your script and see only the error messages run the following command
        	<pre>
bash  hw6.sh  &gt;  /dev/null</pre>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps for Script</h3>
	<ol>
		<li> <!-- Step 1 -->
		Run a command which will show how much free space exists on the file system. <br>
		You <b>must</b> use an option which will show the space in a way that 
	    is easy for human beings, like us, to understand. 
		</li>
		<li> <!-- Step 2 -->
	    Run <code>cat</code> with an option that prints to the terminal a help message for this command.
		</li>
		<li> <!-- Step 3 -->
	    Print to the terminal the value of a variable that shows where the shell will look 
	    for an executable file to match the command you typed at the terminal. 
		</li>
		<li> <!-- Step 4 -->
	    In <span class="path">~tsoro/course_files/it244_files</span> you will find a file named 
	    <span class="path">hello.sh</span>. <br>
	    Stay in your <span class="path">hw6</span> 
	    directory and run <span class="path">hello.sh</span> using an <b>absolute</b> pathname.  <br>
	    Run this script <b>without using</b> <code>bash</code>,  or any other shell, followed by the name
	    of file.
		</li>
		<li> <!-- Step 5 -->
	    Copy <span class="path">hello.sh</span> to your <span class="path">hw6</span> directory. <br>
	    List the contents of your <span class="path">hw6</span> directory to make sure file was copied. <br>
	    Run this copy <span class="path">hello.sh</span> using a <b>relative</b> pathname. <br>
	    You must do this while staying in your 
	    <span class="path">hw6</span> directory and without using <code>bash</code> or any other shell.
		</li>
		<li> <!-- Step 6 -->
	    In the directory <span class="path">/home/tsoro/course_files/it244_files</span>, 
	    you will find a <span class="path">red_sox.txt</span> file. <br>
	    Stay in your <span class="path">hw6</span> directory. <br>
	    Using redirection, create the file <span class="path">red_sox_wins.txt</span>.<br>
	    This file must contain all the entries in <span class="path">red_sox.txt</span> 
	    where the Red Sox won. <br>
	    <b>Do not</b> copy the <span class="path">red_sox.txt</span>
	    file to your <span class="path">hw6</span> but use a relative or absolute path to this file in
	    the <span class="path">/home/tsoro/course_files/it244_files</span> directory. <br>
	    Print the contents of this file to the terminal.
		</li>
		<li> <!-- Step 7 -->
	    List the contents of your current directory. <br>
	    Print to the terminal the exit status of the command you just ran. <br>
	    Try to list the contents of a directory that does not exists like <span class="path">xxxxxxx</span>. <br>
	    Print to the terminal the exit status of the command you just ran. <br>
		</li>
		<li> <!-- Step 8 -->
		Stay in your <span class="path">hw6</span> directory. <br>
	    Using <code>ls</code> and output redirection, create a file named <span class="path">dir_listing.txt</span> 
	    that contains the list of files in your <b>home</b> directory. <br>
	    Print this file to the terminal.
		</li>
		<li> <!-- Step 9 -->
		Stay in your <span class="path">hw6</span> directory. <br>
	    Using redirection, create a file named <span class="path">list.txt</span> containing a list
	    of all the users currently logged in. <br>
	    Print this file to the terminal.
		</li>
		<li> <!-- Step 10 -->
		Stay in your <span class="path">hw6</span> directory. <br>
	    Using redirection, add a listing of the contents of your <span class="path">hw6</span> directory to
	    <span class="path">dir_listing.txt</span>. <br>
	    That is, I want you to keep the original contents of <span class="path">dir_listing.txt</span> intact 
	    while running <code>ls</code> of your current directory to it. <br>
	    Print this file to the terminal.
		</li>
	</ol>
