		<li>
			A shell script named <span class="host">hw4.sh</span> that performs the operations listed below. <br>
        		This file should be in an <span class="host">hw4</span> directory inside your 
        		<span class="host">hw</span> directory inside your <span class="host">it244</span> directory. <br>
        		100 points
  		</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Requirements</h3>
	<ul class="flat">
		<li>Create an <span class="host">hw4</span> directory in your <span class="host">hw</span> directory 
    		inside your <span class="host">it244</span> directory
    	</li>
    	<li>Go to the <span class="host">hw4</span> directory and run Unix commands that will execute the steps below</li>
    	<li>When you have a command line that does what the step asks you to do, paste it into 
			<span class="host">hw4.sh</span> using <code>nano</code> or any other text editor
		</li>
		<li>When you have completed all the steps, create an <code>echo</code> statement before the commands 
    		for each step, that will print the step number to the terminal
    	</li>
    </ul>
    
	<h3>Testing</h3>
	<ul class="flat">     
         <li>The script <span class="host">hw4.sh</span> <b>must</b> have the format specified in

        <li>You will lose 5 points for each error that occurs when running your script</li>
        <li>To run your script and see only the error messages run the following command
        	<pre>
bash  hw4.sh  &gt;  /dev/null</pre>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps for Script</h3>
	<ol>
		<li> <!-- Step 1 -->
			Using <b>one Unix command</b>, go to <b>my</b> home directory using tilde, <span class="char">~</span>. <br>
			Once you are there, show me that you are in the right directory using <code>pwd</code>.
		</li>
		
		<li> <!-- Step 2 -->
			Using <b>one Unix command</b>, go to <b>your</b> home directory using tilde, <span class="char">~</span>. <br>
			Once you are there, show me that you are in the right directory using <code>pwd</code>.
		</li>
		
		<li> <!-- Step 3 -->
	        Make sure you are in <b>your</b> home directory. <br>
			Using <b>one Unix command</b>, go to your <span class="host">hw4</span> directory inside your 
			<span class="host">hw</span> directory, inside your
			<span class="host">it244</span> directory using a <b>relative</b> pathname. <br>
			Once you are there,  show me that you are in the right directory. 
		</li>
		
		<li> <!-- Step 4 -->
			Using <b>one Unix command</b>, go to <b>my</b> home directory using an <b>absolute</b> pathname. <br>
			Once you are there, show me that you are in the right directory.
		</li>
		
		<li> <!-- Step 5 -->
			Using <b>one Unix command</b>, go to the <span class="host">it244_files</span> directory inside 
			the <span class="host">course_files</span> directory, inside <b>my</b> home
			directory, using an <b>absolute</b> pathname. <br>
			Once you are there, show me that you are in the right directory.
		</li>
		
		<li> <!-- Step 6 -->
			Using <b>one Unix command</b>, go to <b>my</b> home directory using a <b>relative</b> pathname employing 
			<span class="char">..</span>. Once you are there, show me that you are in the right directory.
		</li>
		
		<li> <!-- Step 7 -->
		    Using <b>one Unix command</b>, go to <b>your</b> home directory. <br>
		    Once you are there go to your <span class="host">it244</span> directory using a 
			<b>relative</b> pathname. <br>
			Show me that your are in the correct directory. 
		</li>
		
		<li> <!-- Step 8 -->
		    Make sure you are in your <span class="host">it244</span> directory. <br>
			Using <code>touch</code> create a file named <span class="host">test.txt</span>. <br>
			Go to your <span class="host">hw4</span> directory. <br>
			Using <b><span class="char">..</span></b> stay in your <span class="host">hw4</span> directory but list 
			the contents of your <span class="host">it244</span> directory. <br>
		</li>
		
		<li> <!-- Step 9 -->
		    Make sure you are in your <span class="host">hw4</span> directory. <br>
		    Stay in this directory and
			copy the <span class="host">test.txt</span> file from your <span class="host">it244</span> 
			directory to your <span class="host">hw4</span> directory using a <b>relative</b> pathname. <br>
			Show me that the copy operation succeeded by listing the contents of that directory.
		</li>
		
		<li> <!-- Step 10 -->
	        Using <b>one Unix command</b> and multiple instances of <span class="char">..</span> , 
	        go to your home directory. <br>
	        Once you are there, show me  that you are in the right directory. <br>
	        Using <b>one Unix command</b>, copy the <span class="host">test.txt</span> file from your
	        <span class="host">it244/hw/hw4</span> directory to your home directory. <br>
	        List the contents of the directory so I know the copy succeeded.
		</li>
	</ol>
