	<ol>
		<li> <!-- Step 1 -->
	        Copy <span class="path">bother10.sh</span> from <span class="path">/home/tsoro/course_files/it244_files</span> 
	        to your <span class="path">hw7</span> directory. <br>
	        Run this program <b>in the background</b> redirecting output to /dev/null. <br>
	        Be sure you copy and run <span class="path">bother10.sh</span>, <b>NOT</b> <span class="path">bother.sh</span>.
		</li>
		
		<li> <!-- Step 2 -->
	        Run a command that shows the job number of the process running <span class="path">bother10.sh</span>.
		</li>
		
		<li> <!-- Step 3 -->
	        Run a command that shows the process ID of the process running <span class="path">bother10.sh</span>.
		</li>
		
		<li> <!-- Step 4 -->
		   Copy the script <span class="path">make_foo.sh</span> from <span class="path">~tsoro/course_files/it244_files</span>
		   to your current directory. <br>
		   Run this script. <br>
	       Perform a long listing of all files whose name starts with the string "foo" using meta-characters.
		</li>
		
		<li> <!-- Step 5 -->
	        Using meta-characters, perform a long listing of all files whose name starts with the string "foo", 
	        followed by a single character, followed by .txt .
