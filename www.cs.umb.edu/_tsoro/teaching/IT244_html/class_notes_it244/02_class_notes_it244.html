	<ul class="flat">
	    	<li>We will cover most of the chapters in the textbook</li>
	    	<li>We will skip chapters 6 &amp; 7 - the <code>vi</code> and <code>emacs</code> editors</li>
	    	<li>These programs are text editors ...</li>
	    	<li>that are run at the command line ...</li>
	    	<li>They are used to create and modify text files</li>
	    	<li>Text files have no formating ...</li>
	    	<li>like you would find in Microsoft Word</li>
	    	<li>Text files only contain characters</li>
	    	<li>Chapters 6 &amp; 7 show you how to use <code>vi</code> and <code>emacs</code></li>
	    	<li>But the best way to learn an editor is to use it ...</li>
	    	<li>not read about it in a book</li>
	    	<li><code>vi</code> and <code>emacs</code> are full featured <b>text</b> editors</li>
	    	<li>You will need to use a text editor in this course ...</li>
	    	<li>to complete your homework and Class Exercises</li>
	    	<li>But <code>vi</code> and <code>emacs</code> take some time to learn</li>
	    	<li>Instead of teaching you one of these editors ...</li>
	    	<li>I'll show you <code>nano</code>, a simple text editor</li>
	    	<li><code>nano</code> is good enough for our purposes</li>
	    	<li>You do not have to use <code>nano</code></li>
	    	<li>You can use any text editor <b>that runs on Unix/Linux</b></li>
	    	<li>This rules out Notepad or Word</li>
	    	<li>I'll also skip chapter 9 which covers the TC shell ...</li>
	    	<li>because it is not used much these days</li>
	    	<li>We will use the Bash shell in this course</li>
	    	<li>Bash has more features than the TC shell</li>
	    	<li>Bash is the default shell in most Linux installations</li>
	    	<li>We will <b>not</b> be installing Linux in this course</li>
	    	<li>Modern installers are very good - almost idiot proof ...</li>
	    	<li>so installing Linux is little more than running the installer ...</li>
	    	<li>and answering a few simple questions</li>
	    	<li>If you want to install Linux on your machine ...</li>
	    	<li>and are having trouble ...</li>
	    	<li>you can get help from the <a href="http://blu.org/">Boston Linux User Group</a></li>
	    	<li>This group holds periodic "Installfests" at MIT</li>
	    	<li>where knowledgeable people can help you with the installation</li>
	    	<li>All work for the course will be done on a Linux machine ...</li>
	    	<li>running Ubuntu Linux 16.04</li>
	    	<li>We will only use the Windows machines in the Lab ...</li>
	    	<li>to connect to the Linux machine <span class="host">users3.cs.umb.edu</span></li>
	    	<li>You can use your laptop instead of a Windows machine ...</li>
	    	<li>to connect to <span class="host">users3.cs.umb.edu</span></li>
    </ul>

	<ul class="flat">
	    <li>All work for this course will be done on <span class="host">users3.cs.umb.edu</span></li>
		<li>You can connect to <span class="host">users3.cs.umb.edu</span> from home</li>
		<li>To do this, you'll need an Internet connection and an 
		   <a class="def" href="../definitions.html#ssh_client">ssh client</a>
		</li>
		<li>An SSH client is software that uses the 
		   <a class="def" href="../definitions.html#ssh">SSH</a> protocol ...
		</li>
		<li>to connect to a remote Unix/Linux machine</li>
		<li>An SSH client allows you to use one machine ...</li>
		<li>to connect to a machine running Linux or Unix</li>
		<li>When you connect you will get a command line ...</li>
		<li>where you can run any Unix command</li>
		<li>If you have a Mac go to the <span class="path">Utilities</span> directory ...</li>
		<li>inside the <span class="path">Applications</span> directory</li>
		<li>There you will find the <span class="path">Terminal</span> program</li>

		<li>If you have a Mac, read the instructions 
            <a href="../../linux/remote_access_mac.html">here</a>
        </li>
		<li>Windows does not come with an ssh client ...</li>
		<li>but many free ones are available</li>
		<li>The SSH client I recommend for Windows is PuTTY ...</li>

	<ul class="flat">
	   	<li>The <a class="def" href="../definitions.html#operating_system">operating system</a> 
	   		is the software that allows you to use a computer
		</li>
		<li>The textbook defines an operating system as 
			<pre>
An operating system is the low-level software that schedules tasks, 
allocates storage, and handles the interfaces to peripheral hardware, 
such as printers, disk drives, the screen, keyboard, and mouse</pre>
		</li>
		<li>An operating system like a city government</li>
		<li>A city government provides resources - water, sewage, snow plowing</li>
		<li>It also provides protection - police and fire departments</li>
		<li>The operating system provides resources ...</li>
		<li>like access to memory, files and devices</li>
		<li>It also provides protection to keep one program ...</li>
		<li>from interfering with another ...</li>
		<li>and to keep other people from messing with your files</li>
		<li>Every computer has an operating system of some sort</li>
		<li>Nowadays computers are found in most of the durable goods you buy ...</li>
		<li>like cars and refrigerators</li>
		<li>You never see these computers ...</li>
		<li>but they are there making everything work properly</li>
		<li>These "invisible" computers are called embedded systems</li>
		<li>They too have operating systems ...</li>
		<li>but they are much simpler than those on a desktop or laptop</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4 class="topic" id="components_operating_system">Components of the Operating System</h4>
    <ul class='flat'>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The kernel is a program that is always running</li>
        <li>It controls all access to any hardware connected to the machine</li>
        <li>Every program that runs on a computer needs resources ...</li>
        <li>like memory and access to files</li>
        <li>It gets these resources from the kernel</li>
        <li>The kernel is like a traffic cop</li>
        <li>The kernel makes sure that two programs don't use the same resource ...</li>
        <li>at the same time</li>
        <li>Utilities are programs that allow you use and manage computer resources</li>
    </ul>
	
	<h4 class="topic" id="unix">Unix</h4>
	<ul class="flat">
	   <li>I will use the terms Unix and Linux interchangeably in this course ...</li>
	   <li>but they are distinct</li>
	   <li>Unix is an operating system developed as a research tool at Bell Labs</li>
	   <li>Bell Labs was created as a research facility ...</li>
	   <li>for the Bell telephone system</li>
	   <li>Some of the most important advances of the 20th century ...</li>
	   <li>came from Bell Labs</li>
	   <li>Researchers there have won many <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/our-people/recognition/">awards</a> ...</li>
	   <li>including some very important Nobel Prizes</li>
	   <li>Unix has a number of powerful features</li>
	   <li>It is often used in academic, engineering and research environments</li>
	   <li>Unix was developed before Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) become common</li>
	   <li>The Unix philosophy is to create many small programs ...</li>
	   <li>that do one thing well</li>
	   <li>Unix allows simple tools to be strung together ...</li>
	   <li>to perform a complex task</li>
	   <li>This allows people to write commands that do complicated things ...</li>
	   <li>on the fly</li>
	   <li>When first created, Unix was given away free to universities ...</li>
	   <li>and many Computer Science students learned to use it ...</li>
	   <li>and grew to like its power</li>
	   <li>Talented programmers down through the years have made many contributions to Unix ...</li>
	   <li>which improved it greatly</li>
	   <li>This tradition continues with Linux</li>
    </ul>

	<h4 class="topic" id="different_unix_releases">Different Unix Releases</h4>
	<ul class="flat">
    		<li>There is no single collection of software that can be called Unix or Linux</li>
    		<li>A Linux/Unix distributions consist of
    		<ul class="flat">       
        		<li class="flat">Kernel</li>
			<li class="flat">Utilities</li>
			<li class="flat"><a class="def" href="../definitions.html#application">Applications</a></li>
		</ul>
    		</li>
    		<li>The kernel is always present in the computer's memory ...</li>
    		<li>and deals directly with the hardware ...</li>
    		<li>like the CPU, memory and the hard disc</li>
    		<li>A program cannot talk directly to the hardware ...</li>
    		<li>but must do so through the kernel</li>
    		<li>The utilities help you use the machine's resources</li>
    		<li>Applications are programs that are used to get work done ...</li>
        <li>such as a word processor or an email client</li>
    		<li>Over the years a number of different Unix distribution have appeared</li>
    		<li>One popular Unix distribution is BSD ...</li>
    		<li>which stands for Berkeley Software Distribution</li>
    		<li>It was developed by the Computer Systems Research Group ...</li>
    		<li>at the University of California at Berkeley</li>
        <li>Berkeley charges nothing for this Unix</li>
        <li>The BSD license is the least restricted open source license</li>
        <li>See <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">
            http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php</a> for more information
        </li>
        <li>The Macintosh runs a customized version of Unix ...</li>   
        <li>that comes mainly from BSD</li>
        <li>Another popular Unix distribution is Unix System V</li>
        <li>It was released commercially  by AT&amp;T ...</li>
        <li>the original corporate sponsor of Bell Labs</li>
        <li>There were four major releases of  System V</li>
        <li>Release 4, abbreviated SVR4, enjoyed the greatest commercial success</li>
        <li>The Unix used at UMB was, until recently, Solaris</li>
        <li>Solaris was developed by Sun Microsystems as a commercial product</li>
        <li>Subsequently, Sun released most of the code base as an open source project ...</li>
        <li>called Open Solaris</li>
        <li>Sun was acquired by Oracle in January 2010</li>
        <li>We now use the Ubuntu Linux distribution at UMB</li>
    </ul>

	<h4 class="topic" id="gnu_fsf">GNU and the Free Software Foundation</h4>
	<ul class="flat">
		<li>Richard Stallman is a legendary figure in the Unix world </li>
		<li>He received a MacArthur "genius" grant</li>
		<li>He worked for many years at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</li>
		<li>When Stallman started programming there was no software industry ...</li>
		<li>as we know it today</li>
		<li>The software came with the hardware ...</li>
		<li>and companies sometimes distributed the source code ...</li>
		<li>along with the machines</li>
		<li>Stallman and his associates liked this open environment ...</li>
		<li>where ideas could be shared freely</li>
		<li>In these early days, companies were not too concerned about trade secrets</li>
		<li>Stallman and his fellow programmers had access to the source code ...</li>
		<li>for the programs they used</li>
		<li>When a bug was discovered, they could look in the source code ...</li>
		<li>and fix the problem directly</li>
		<li>As the software industry became more commercialized ...</li>
		<li>companies refused to release their source code</li>
		<li>They wanted to sell software independently from the hardware ...</li>
		<li>and to do this they needed to keep the source code secret</li>
		<li>This this bothered Stallman</li>
		<li>He could no longer look at the source code ...</li>
		<li>to fix the bugs he found</li>
		<li>Instead, he had to report the bug to the company ...</li>
		<li>and then wait for a fix</li>
		<li>In 1983, Stallman announced plans for the GNU Operating System</li>
		<li>It would be distributed under the GNU License ...</li>
		<li>and would be compatible with Unix</li>
		<li>GNU is a recursive acronym ...</li>
		<li>that stands for "GNU is not Unix"</li>
		<li>In 1985 Stallman founded the Free Software Foundation</li>
		<li>It's mission was to develop GNU software ...</li>
		<li>and to advance the cause of free software</li>
		<li>By "free" Stallman meant that every user has the right to read ...</li>
		<li>and modify the source code</li>
		<li>It did not mean that an organization could not charge for the software</li>
		<li>The software was "Free as in speech, not beer"</li>
		<li>The Free Software Foundation charged a modest amount for its software</li>
		<li>Stallman's definition of free software is very strict ...</li>
		<li>and he distinguishes it from open source software</li>
		<li>Stallman has written books on the subject of free software ...</li>
		<li>which can be obtained from the <a href="http://shop.fsf.org/category/books/">
		    Free Software Foundation</a></li>
		<li>The GNU License is fairly elaborate</li>
		<li>If any person or company makes a change to software distributed under the GPL ...</li>
		<li>they must distribute the improved source code under the same license</li>
		<li>This means a company cannot take software distributed under the GPL ...</li>
		<li>make some improvements ...</li>
		<li>and then sell it as proprietary software</li>
		<li>The GNU project first focused on developing tools ...</li>
		<li>that could be used to write the software for the operating system</li>
		<li>Their most important contributions were the programmable text editor, <code>emacs</code> ...</li>
		<li>and the compiler, <code>gcc</code></li>
		<li>Most of Unix is written in C ...</li>
		<li>so developing the GNU C compiler was an important first step</li>
		<li>Work on the kernel, the heart of the operating system ...</li>
		<li>was saved for last ...</li>
		<li>since it would be the most difficult</li>
		<li>The GNU kernel was to be named Hurd</li>

	   <li>In the early 90's as Linus Torvalds was working on his Masters thesis</li>
	   <li>At this time he began a personal project ...</li>
	   <li>that eventually became a Unix-like kernel</li>
	   <li>He released the source code for this kernel to the public</li>
	   <li>Many programmers looked at this code and liked it</li>
	   <li>They sent in improvements which Linus added to the code</li>
	   <li>This improved kernel was widely in open source circles</li>
	   <li>Together with many of the GNU tools ...</li>
	   <li>it formed the core of what came to be called Linux</li>

        <li>followed, perhaps, by options and arguments ...</li>
        <li>and then hit Enter ...</li>
        <li>or Return on a Mac</li>
        <li>Options change what the command does</li>
        <li>For example the <code>ls</code> command lists the contents of a directory
        <pre>
    $ ls
    foo.txt  it244  work</pre></li>
	    <li>When <code>ls</code> is used with the <code>-l</code> (for <b>l</b>ong) option ...</li>

        <pre>
    $ ls html
    it244_sum17_html  it341_f16_html</pre></li>
	   <li>Most Unix/Linux commands are very short, to save typing ...</li>
	   <li>and usually have mnemonic  value</li>
	   <li>For example, <code>ls</code> stands for "list"</li>
