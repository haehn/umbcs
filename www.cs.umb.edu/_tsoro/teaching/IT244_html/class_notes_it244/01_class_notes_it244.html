    <h4 class="topic" id="course_description">Course Description</h4>
    <p class="flat">This course will introduce you to the Linux/Unix operating system
        and the Bash shell.
    </p>
    <p>All work in this course will be done at the command line on a Linux
       machine on the Computer Science Department network.
    </p>
	<p>The command line is harder to use than the graphical user interfaces
       you are used to.
    </p>
    <p>But the command line is more powerful and gives you full access to all
       the features of the operating system.
    </p>
    
    <h4 class="topic" id="textbook">Textbook</h4>
    <p class="flat">The text for this course is 
       <span class="under">A Practical Guide to Linux Commands, Editors, and Shell Programming</span>
       by Mark G. Sobell and Matthew Helmke, Fourth Edition, Prentice Hall <br>

    <h4 class="topic" id="what_happens_in_class">What Happens in Class</h4>
    <p class="flat">This is a combined lecture and lab course.</p>
    <p>I will speak for a while at the beginning of the class.</p>
    <p>After my prepared material, there will be an ungraded quiz.</p>
    <p>The purpose of the ungraded quiz is to help you remember the new material we have covered.</p>
    <p>After you have completed the quiz I will hand out a Class Exercise.</p>
    <p>You will work on the exercise for the remainder of the class.</p>
    <p>There will also be weekly graded quizzes.</p>
    
    <h4 class="topic" id="course_work">Course Work</h4>
    <p class="flat">In each class you will receive a Class Exercise, 
            which consists of code that you must copy and run on our Unix systems.
        </p>
    <p>You must work on each exercise in class so I can help you if you run into trouble.</p>
    <p>If you cannot complete the exercise in class, you may finish it later.</p>
    <p>Class Exercises for the week must be submitted by Sunday at 11:59 PM.</p>
    <p>Each Class Exercise will be graded on completion.</p>
    <p>If the code does everything it should do and does not show any errors, 
           you will receive the full 100 points for that exercise.
        </p>
    <p class="flat">There will be two types of quizzes</p>
    <ul class="flat">       
        <li class="flat">Class Quizzes</li>
        <li class="flat">Weekly Quizzes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Class Quizzes are administered at the end of each class and are <b>not</b> graded.</p>
    <p>The purpose of the Class Quizzes is to help you learn the material.</p>
    <p>Studies have shown that taking a quiz immediately after hearing new material helps you learn.</p>
    <p>The Weekly Quizzes are graded.</p>
    <p>Their purpose is to encourage you to study the material as we go along, 
       and not postpone this until just before the exams.
    </p>
    <p>All questions on the Weekly Quizzes come from the ungraded Class Quizzes.</p>
    <p>They will usually cover the material from the previous week.</p>
    <p>The weekly graded quizzes will be given in the first class of the week, starting 
           on the third week of class.
    </p>
    <p>If you miss this class your only other opportunity to take the quiz, 
       will be the following class.
    </p>
    <p>There will usually be a weekly reading assignment from the textbook.</p>
    <p>There will be weekly homework assignments.</p>
    <p class="flat">There will be two exams</p>
    <ul class="flat">       
        <li class="flat">A mid-term</li>
        <li class="flat">A final</li>

    <h4 class="topic" id="making_class_interesting">Making the Class Interesting</h4>
    <!--
	<p class="flat">The first universities appeared in Europe over 1,000 year ago.</p>
    <p>Since then, the what happens in classrooms has not changed much.</p>
    <p>The teacher stands at the front of the class and lectures to the students.</p>
    <p>The word "lecture" comes from the Latin word for read.</p>
    <p>The first universities arose before the printing press.</p>
    <p>There were no textbooks.</p>
    <p>Books had to be copied by hand so they were very expensive and rare.</p>
    <p>The instructor read from one of these books and the students took notes.</p>
    <p>Students had to study from their notes, because there were no textbooks.</p>
    <p>Much has changed since then, but most teachers in universities still lecture.</p>
    <p>Recent research has shown that this is not an effective way to learn.</p>
	-->
    <p>Students learn by doing and by interacting with the instructor.</p>
    <p>The more students participate in class, the more they learn.</p>
    <p>I want you to interact with me.</p>
    <p>I want you to ask questions.</p>
    <p>I want you to make comments.</p>
    <p>The more you interact with me, the more you learn.</p>
    <p>This will make the class more interesting for you and for me.</p>
	<!--
    <p>I will take note of the students who speak up.</p>
    <p>Such student may get a point or two added to their score when I calculate grades.</p>
    -->
    <!--
    <h4 class="topic" id="taking_notes">Taking Notes</h4>
    <p class="flat">When I first taught at UMB I printed the Class Notes 
        and handed them out to students.
    </p>
    <p>I don't do this anymore because I want you to take notes.</p>
    <p>Studies have shown that students learn more when they take notes.</p>
    <p>This is true <b>even if the students never look at their notes again</b>.</p>
    <p>The more senses you engage when studying, the more you learn.</p>
    <p>The act of writing engages different parts of the brain then when you just listen.</p>
    <p>This increases what you remember.</p>
    <p>Other studies have show that writing notes by hand, is better than typing.</p>
    <p>Some people type so fast, that they don't process what they type.</p>
    <p>All of you should take notes.</p>
    <p>Another effective study technique is to rewrite my class notes in your own words.</p>
    -->
    <h4 class="topic" id="laptops">Laptops</h4>
    <p class="flat">If you have a laptop, you should bring it to class.</p>
    <p>There will be a Class Exercise for each class.</p>
    <p>Class Exercises require you to copy commands from the handout
       to the Unix command line.
    </p>
    <p>You do not have to finish these exercises in class, but you should
       start working on them while you are here.
    </p>
    <p>This will allow me to help you if you run into trouble.</p>
    <p>I will check all class exercises.</p>
	<!--
    <p><b>You should only use your laptops while working on the Class Exercises</b></p>
    <p>Studies have shown that students who use laptops in class do less well 
       than students who don't.
    </p>
    <p>You can read a summary of these results 
        <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/students-are-better-off-without-a-laptop-in-the-classroom/">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>The studies show that most students who use laptops in class spend most of their time viewing 
        material that has no relation to the subject discussed in class.
    </p>
    <p>For this reason <b>you should not use your laptops except when working on the Class Exercises</b></p>
    <p>Some of you may claim that you need to use your laptops to take notes.</p>
    <p>As I mentioned above, studies have shown that students learn more when they take notes 
       by hand instead of using a laptop.
    </p>
    <p>You can find one such study 
        <a href="https://sites.udel.edu/victorp/files/2010/11/Psychological-Science-2014-Mueller-0956797614524581-1u0h0yu.pdf">
            here
        </a>.
    </p>
    <p>If you insist on using your laptop while I am speaking you <b>must</b> fill out
       a form that I will give you.
    </p>
    <p>On this form you will enter your name, Student ID and date.</p>
    <p>You must fill out this form for <b>each class where you take notes</b>.</p>
    <p>Then you must email me a copy of the notes you took in class by Sunday at 11:59 PM.</p>
    <p>If you do not, you will lose 5 points on the Weekly Quiz for each class 
       where you did not email your notes.
    </p>
    -->
    <h4 class="topic" id="attendance">Attendance</h4>
    <p class="flat">I will take attendance at the end of each class.</p>
    <p>I do this to learn your names.</p>
    <p>Your attendance will not directly affect your grade.</p>
    <p>But I am more likely to give you the benefit of the doubt when grading if
       you have been regularly  attending class.
    </p>
    
    <h4 class="topic" id="who_am_i">Who Am I</h4>
    <p class="flat">My name is T. Omar Soro.</p>
    <p>My official title at Umass Boston is Lecturer.</p>
    <p>I am also an associate professor of Economics at Bunker Hill community college.
    </p>
    <p>You can addresses by my first name, Omar.</p>
	<p>I have a Master in Computer Science from Umass Boston.</p>
    <p>I also have a PhD in Economics from the University of Southern California (USC).</p>
    
    <h4 class="topic" id="enough_time">Do You Have Enough Time to Do the Work for This Course?</h4> 
    <p class="flat">Many of you work, either part or full time.</p>
    <p>This cuts down on the time you have for study.</p>
    <p>Technical courses are filled with details where accuracy is very important.</p>
    <p>They also introduce concepts which may take some time to fully understand.</p>
    <p>For this reason, they require a significant amount of study time in order to do well.</p>
    <p>This studying should not be done on one day, but spread out over the days of the week.</p>
    <p>You should not be taking this course if you are not able to devote several hours
       a week to it.
    </p>
    <p>Too many people rush to finish a degree without doing the work to really learn the material.</p>
    <p>These people are setting themselves up for professional failure.</p>
    <p>If you try to do too much ...</p>
    <p>you will end up doing too little.</p>
    
    <h4 class="topic" id="read_carefully">Learn to Read Carefully</h4>
    <p class="flat">Most of us spend a large part of each day reading.</p>
    <p>Most of this reading is done quickly because the material is familiar 
    	   and the details are not that important.
    </p>
    <p>For example, if you get an email from a friend, you don't linger over each word.</p>
    <p>Most of us do this quickly because we know what to expect.</p>
	<p>You have some idea of what he or she is going to say, so you can read it quickly.</p>
    <p>The same thing happens when you read an account of the last game of your favorite team.</p>
    <p>The details aren't important, just the overall picture.</p>
    <p>The reading you will do for this course is different.</p>
    <p>Technical work is detailed work.</p>
    <p>If you read technical material too quickly, you will miss important details.</p>
    <p>You must learn to read technical material slowly and carefully.</p>
    <p>You must learn to reread something you have already read until you fully understand it.</p>
    <p>Learning this skill may be the most important thing you take away from this class.</p>

    <p>For this reason, it is important that you forward your UMB email to an account
       you check regularly.
    </p>
    <p>Forwarding you UMB email is part of your first homework assignment.</p>
	
    <h4 class="topic" id="disabilities">Accommodations for Disabilities</h4>
    <p class="flat">Section 504 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 
        offers guidelines for curriculum modifications 
        and adaptations for students with documented disabilities.
    </p>
    <p>Students may obtain adaptation recommendations from the Ross Center for Disability Services.</p>
    <p>Their web site is 
       <a href="https://www.umb.edu/academics/vpass/disability">https://www.umb.edu/academics/vpass/disability</a>.
    </p>
    <p>A student must present these recommendations and discuss them with me within a reasonable period, 
       preferably by the end of Add/Drop period.
    </p>
    
    <h4 class="topic" id="classroom_behavior">Classroom Behavior</h4>
    <p class="flat">I put a lot of work into my classes.</p>
    <p>If I see you looking furtively at your cell phone while I'm talking, 
       I wonder why I am doing this.
    </p>
    <p>If I hear you having an extensive conversation with your neighbor, 
       it makes me feel that I am wasting my time here.
    </p>
    <p>I could make more money doing other things, but I find this work important.</p>
    <p>I am working hard to teach you important material.</p>
    <p>Please respect that effort while you are in this room.</p>
    
    <h4 class="topic" id="cheating">Cheating</h4>
    <p>One of the fundamental principles of academics is honesty.</p>
    <p>Would you take a course from an instructor who lied or distorted the truth?</p>
    <p>Just as this University expects honesty from its teachers, it expects the
       the same from its students.
    </p>
    <p>All work you turn in for this course must be original or credited to the source from which it came.</p>
    <p>It is <b>not</b> acceptable to copy a file from another student.</p>
    <p>Every file you submit must be created by you.</p>
    <p>Answers on quizzes and tests must come from your understanding of the material.</p>
    <p>I will run software to check for students copying the work of other students.</p>
    <p>If you cheat on any quiz, exam or assignment you will receive a score of 0 
       and the incident will be reported to the Computer Science Department,
       with consequences that could affect your status as a student.
    </p>
    <p>I know that sometimes students cheat when the instructor has failed as a teacher.</p>    
    <p>From the reactions of my previous students, I don't think that you will find me a poor instructor.</p>
    <p>I put a great deal of work into my courses.</p>
    <p>I am asking you to respect that work.</p>
    <p>I am asking you not to cheat.</p>
