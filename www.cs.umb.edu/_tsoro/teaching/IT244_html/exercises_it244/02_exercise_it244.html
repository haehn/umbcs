	<h3>Logging in to <span class="host">users3</span></h3>
	<p class="flat">We'll be using the Windows machines in this room, or your laptops ,
	   to connect to the Linux machine <span class="host">users3</span> for all the 
	   class exercises in this course.
	</p>
	 
	 
	<ul>
		<li><span class="under">Install <span class="path">putty.exe</span> if you have a Windows machine</span><br>
            Download it from <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html">
            https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html</a>. <br>
            For more information go to
            <a href="../../linux/remote_access_windows.html">
            	https://www.cs.umb.edu/~tsoro/teaching/linux/remote_access_windows.html
            </a>
        </li>
        <li><span class="under">Run the Terminal program if you have a Mac</span><br>
			You will find this program in the <span class="path">Utilities</span> directory 
			inside the <span class="path">Applications</span> directory. <br>
			For more information go to
			<a href="../../linux/remote_access_mac.html">
				https://www.cs.umb.edu/~tsoro/teaching/linux/remote_access_mac.html
			</a>
		</li>
		<li><span class="under">Run the ssh client</span><br>
			Use the values in the table below to connect to the virtual machine
			we'll be using in this class.
			<br><br>
			In the value for "host" listed below, the first part of the string, "users3", specifies the 
			machine, on the Unix network, that you will connect to.
			<br><br>
			<table>
		    <tr>
		      <th align="left">ssh configuration parameter</th>
		      <th align="left">value</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>protocol</td><td>ssh</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>ssh version</td><td>2</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>ssh port</td><td>22</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>host</td><td><span class="host">users3.cs.umb.edu</span></td>

			<tr>
				<td>Authentication method</td><td>password</td>   
			</tr>
			</table><br>
		</li>
		<li><span class="under">Enter your password</span><br>
			A dialog box will appear on the screen into which you must type the
			password for your Unix account.<br>
		</li>
		<li><span class="under">Confirm that you are connected</span><br>
				You should see the following<pre>
Welcome to Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.4.0-59-generic x86_64)</pre>
		</li>
		<li><span class="under">Learn More About the Machine to Which You Are Connected</span><br>
				The <code>uname</code> command displays information about the machine you are using.
			<pre>
uname -a</pre>
				When used with the -a option, <code>uname</code> displays
				more information than just the name of the machine.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Your Shell</h3>
	<ul class="flat">
		<li><span class="under">Determine Your Current Shell</span><br>
			The easiest way to determine your current shell is to use the
			<code>ps</code> (<b>p</b>rocess <b>s</b>tatus) command.
			<pre>
ps</pre>
			The <code>ps</code> command shows all your running processes, including
			your shell, bash.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Explore Your Home Directory</h3>
	<ul class="flat">
		<li><span class="under">Learn Your Current Location</span><br>
			At every point in your Unix session, you are working inside 
			some directory. 
			<br><br>
			When you log in, you will be in your home directory. 
			<br><br>
			You can create subdirectories inside your home
			directory, and customize your environment through special
			files located here. 
			<br><br>
			To determine your current location, you
			will use the <code>pwd</code> command, which stands for "<b>p</b>rint <code>w</code>orking <code>d</code>irectory".
			<pre>
pwd</pre>
			Notice that your home directory has the same name as your username,
			and is located inside <span class="path">/home</span>. 
			<br><br>
			This is true for all users.
		</li>
		<li><span class="under">Look at the Contents of Your Home Directory</span><br>
			The ls command (for "<b>l</b>i<b>s</b>t"), when used with no arguments,
			will display the contents of your current directory.
			<pre>
ls</pre>
			You should see at least one directory - <span class="path">it244</span>.
			<br><br>
			You will use this directory for all your class assignments.
		</li>
		<li><span class="under">Look at Your "Invisible" files</span><br>
				Normally <code>ls</code> will <b>not</b> show files whose
				first character is a <span class="char">.</span> (dot). 
				<br><br>
				These are special files used to change features of your Unix environment. 
				<br><br>
				To see these files, you need to use <code>ls</code> with the -a option:
			<pre>
ls -a</pre>
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Create directories for your homework and Class Exercises</h3>
	<ul class="flat">
		<li><span class="under">Make sure you are in your home directory</span><br>
			<pre>
	cd</pre>
		</li>
		<li><span class="under">Go to your <span class="path">it244</span> directory</span><br>
			<pre>
	cd it244</pre>
		</li>
		<li><span class="under">Create an <span class="path">hw</span> directory</span><br>
			<pre>
	mkdir hw</pre>
		</li>
		<li><span class="under">Create an <span class="path">ex</span> directory</span><br>
			<pre>
	mkdir ex</pre>
		</li>
		<li><span class="under">Check that the directories were created</span><br>
			<pre>
	ls</pre>
		You should see two directories <span class="path">hw</span> and <span class="path">ex</span>
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Wrap Up</h3>
	<ul class="flat">
		<li><span class="under">Tell me when you have completed this Class Exercise</span><br>
			I need to check your work
			<br><br>
		</li>
		<li><span class="under">Disconnect from <span class="host">users3</span></span><br>
			<pre>
exit</pre>
		</li>
	</ul>
